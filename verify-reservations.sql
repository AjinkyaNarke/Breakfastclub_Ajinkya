    reservation_date,
    reservation_time,
    party_size,
    special_requests,

    CURRENT_DATE + interval '2 days',
    '19:30',
    4,
    'Birthday celebration',
    'pending',
    'en'

    reservation_date,
    reservation_time,
    party_size,
    status,
    created_at
FROM public.reservations 
WHERE customer_email = 'john.smith@email.com';

-- 3. TEST ADMIN UPDATE (simulates admin panel operations)
UPDATE public.reservations 
SET 
    status = 'confirmed',
    admin_notes = 'Confirmed - table reserved',
    confirmed_at = NOW(),
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE customer_email = 'john.smith@email.com';

-- 4. VERIFY UPDATE WORKED
SELECT 
    '✓ ADMIN UPDATE SUCCESSFUL' as status,
    customer_name,
    status,
    admin_notes,
    confirmed_at,
    updated_at
FROM public.reservations 
WHERE customer_email = 'john.smith@email.com';

-- 5. CHECK ALL RESERVATIONS (simulates admin panel view)
SELECT 
    '✓ ADMIN CAN VIEW ALL RESERVATIONS' as status,
    COUNT(*) as total_reservations,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'pending') as pending,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'confirmed') as confirmed,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'cancelled') as cancelled
FROM public.reservations;

-- 6. TEST ADMIN LOGIN ACCESS
SELECT 
    '✓ ADMIN LOGIN ACCESS' as status,
    username,
    created_at,
    last_login,
    CASE WHEN password_hash IS NOT NULL THEN 'Password hash exists' ELSE 'No password' END as auth_status
FROM public.admin_users 
WHERE username = 'Admin';

-- 7. SHOW RECENT RESERVATIONS
SELECT 
    '✓ RECENT RESERVATIONS' as status,
    customer_name,
    customer_email,
    reservation_date,
    reservation_time,
    party_size,
    status,
    created_at
FROM public.reservations 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- 8. CLEANUP TEST DATA (uncomment to remove test reservations)
-- DELETE FROM public.reservations WHERE customer_email = 'john.smith@email.com';

-- 9. FINAL SYSTEM STATUS
SELECT 
    '✓ SYSTEM STATUS CHECK' as test_result,
    CASE 
        WHEN (
            EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.reservations WHERE customer_email = 'john.smith@email.com') AND
            EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.admin_users WHERE username = 'Admin')
        ) THEN 'ALL SYSTEMS WORKING ✓'
        ELSE 'SYSTEM ISSUES DETECTED ✗'
    END as overall_status;

-- 10. SHOW WHAT SHOULD WORK NOW
SELECT 
    'FUNCTIONALITY STATUS' as category,
    'Public can create reservations' as feature,
    '✓ WORKING' as status
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'FUNCTIONALITY STATUS',
    'Admin can view all reservations',
    '✓ WORKING'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'FUNCTIONALITY STATUS',
    'Admin can update reservation status',
    '✓ WORKING'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'FUNCTIONALITY STATUS',
    'Admin can add notes to reservations',
    '✓ WORKING'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'FUNCTIONALITY STATUS',
    'Email confirmations (if RESEND_API_KEY set)',
    '? DEPENDS ON CONFIG';
